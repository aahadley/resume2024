\cvevent{Theorem Proving with Deep Reinforcement Learning}{UCF Computer Science Department}{January 2019 -- December 2019}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigated deep learning techniques for automated theorem proving software.
     \item Used Microsoft's Lean prover to interact with a deep learning interface.
    \item Extended Google's Deepmath theorem prover to be configurable via Jupyter notebook.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Rework bullet-points to be more quantitative.
